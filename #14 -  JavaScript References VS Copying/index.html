      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // const players2 = players;
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // const players2 = players.slice();
      // const players2 = [...players];
      // const players2 = Array.from(players);
      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      console.clear();
      const person = {
        name: "Yosua",
        age: 21,
        social: {
          twitter: "@siyosua",
          instagram: "@siyosu",
        },
      };

      console.log(person);
      // const person2 = person;
      // const person2 = { ...person };
      // const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
      const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
